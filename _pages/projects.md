# The Real Effects of Debt Relief on Education Outcomes

## Overview
This project evaluates the long-term impact of capital investments in school infrastructure on student performance and early labor market outcomes. I analyze a quasi-natural experiment in Texas, where state programs subsidized school district debt payments—providing exogenous variation in capital spending, especially for debt-constrained districts. The results show that increased capital spending led to higher test scores, improved graduation rates, and modest gains in early-career earnings.

## Objectives
- Examine whether increased capital investment improves student outcomes.
- Focus on the effects of marginal capital projects initiated by heavily indebted school districts, where funding constraints are most binding.

---

## Data Sources

- **Texas Education Agency (TEA)** – Student-level K-12 data
- **Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB)** – College outcomes
- **National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)** – School finances
- **Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS)** – District demographics and performance
- **U.S. Census (1990 & 2000)** – Socioeconomic controls

---

## Tools & Techniques

- **Languages**: Python, Stata
- **Methods**:
  - Two-stage least squares (2SLS)
  - Difference-in-differences
- **Data Engineering**:
  - Merging and cleaning multi-source administrative data
  - Imputing policy eligibility from funding formulas
  - Standardizing scores and constructing derived metrics

## Methodology - Instrumental Variable

### Step 1: Instrumental Variable Construction
To isolate the causal effect of capital investment, I use an instrumental variable strategy. This is necessary because wealthier districts can both afford more capital spending and achieve better outcomes for reasons unrelated to infrastructure, creating endogeneity concerns in naïve comparisons.

- **Instrument**: `DTL_High × Post`
- DTL_High: High pre-policy debt-to-property-tax-levy ratio (1987–1991)
- Post: Indicator for post-policy period (1998 onward)
- Motivation: Districts with high pre-existing debt burdens are more likely to benefit from state subsidies, 

### Step 2: 2SLS Regression

- **First Stage**:  
  Capital spending instrumented using policy interaction  
  `Cap_{i,t} = π(DTL_High × Post) + controls + FE + ε`

- **Second Stage**:  
  Estimate impact of capital on outcomes  
  `Ȳ_{i,t} = β × Ĉap_{i,t} + controls + FE + u`

- **Outcomes Measured**:
  - Standardized test scores (reading & math)
  - Graduation & attendance rates
  - College enrollment & exam participation
  - Early-career income (ages 24–26)

# Investing in Schools: How Debt Relief Helps Students Succeed through Better Facilities

## Summary
This study examines how capital spending affects educational outcomes in debt-laden school districts. Using a quasi-natural experiment with Texas debt relief programs, I find that state-supported infrastructure investments significantly improve student performance and graduation rates. The results highlight the long-term benefits of financial intervention in school districts with limited debt capacity.

## Problem Statement
How does capital spending in debt-laden school districts impact educational outcomes?

## Data Sources
- Texas Education Agency (TEA): K-12 individual student outcomes and school district finances.
- Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB): College enrollment data.
- National Center for Education Statistics (NCES): School district income statement information.
- U.S. Census Data – Local economic indicators.

## Methodology

## Key Findings
1. Impact of Debt Relief on Capital Spending
- Debt relief programs increased capital spending by $570 per student (+22% over 3 years).

2. Educational Outcomes
- Test Scores:
A $1,000 increase per pupil in capital spending raised 8th-grade reading scores by 0.06 and math scores by 0.12 standard deviations.
Effects were delayed but long-lasting, with gains materializing 5+ years post-investment.
- Graduation & Attendance:
Graduation rates increased by 1.9 percentage points.
Attendance rates improved by 0.12 percentage points.
- College & Labor Market Outcomes:
Small but positive effects on college entrance exam participation (+1.3 p.p.) and college enrollment (+0.9 p.p.).
Early-career earnings increased by ~2% per year for non-college-educated students
